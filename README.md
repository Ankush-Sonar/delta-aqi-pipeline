# AQI FORECASTING with XGBOOST

Delta AQI Pipeline implements a scalable data processing workflow using Delta Lake to ingest, transform, and manage Air Quality Index (AQI) data from public APIs. The pipeline follows Medallion architecture (bronze, silver, gold layers) for data quality evolution and supports incremental processing with ACID transactions.
